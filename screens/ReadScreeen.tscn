 This game is still in development, it's my very first game and it's also a very ambitious project (Part of an even more ambitious project).
 With this in mind, expect problems like the following:
* There's no Save/Load system because that requires fully understanding the structure of this game and making sure things work well 
 (The few things that should be affected are the levels and the life system). I may need lots of help on this one.
* Pressing Q and other keys at the same time isn't the best method but it was done as a response to feedback of the older system
 including more specific buttons.
* When the Player presses Q + left/right on ice, it stops the sliding.
* The current Pause Menu scene isn't AutoLoad/\"universal\" because it's set as a node under a CanvasLayer scene 
 in each level, so i may have to make this as an actual recurring game scene.
* The Pause Menu doesn't pause the SceneManager's scene changing animation: Therefore the scene changing animation 
 still plays and changes the scene (And i only didn't make the Pause Menu AutoLoad because 
 i don't know how to make it unavailable in certain scenes like the Main Menu). 
* If the Player is on a different state type (Like swimming) from the Companion
 (Like walking normally on floor), then you'll get weird movement from the Companion.
* Current health bars are attached to the main characters but i used CanvasLayer nodes to put them on the screen like a HUD/UI system.
* Small things like how when a Falling Platform disappears or when pushing a Pushable object the Player and
 Companion have small/subtle physics differences that just look weird.
* I guess the Companion's swimming could be slightly better though right now it doesn't bother me that much. It's okay at least.
* Maybe the Water scene in general is a bit messy.
* There may be a subtle bug on Companion during \"Pushing\" animation where it returns to \"Running\" while on PUSHRUN state i guess.
* Level design in general since even if i get enough working/functional mechanics, i need to use them well, make the game fun and be creative.
* Art in general because even if some art here is placeholder/test based, my art skills are still a mess and i try
 to get creative with weird methods like tracing over 3D models. I try to tweak some stuff
 but may i could use other people's help, even if i also want to \"preserve\" some
 decisions like wanting a bit of inconsistency because of the \"amateur\"/hobby nature of this game.
* Visuals in general are weird because of the resolution, so the game looks like it has
 pixels moving/changing on their own; I'm not sure if it has to do with the camera, window or the art
 (And this issue may get even more complicated to fix because of small details and overlooked things to consider).
* Controls/Inputs need to be better and not feel annoying.
* The soccer ball's bouncing sound may still feel weird, at least based on how many times it should play its sound.
* The sound for the Pushable vase doesn't loop in the way i'd like to, even if it technically works.
* The off-screen pointer for the Companion is placed weirdly but i did all i could do based on my knowledge.     "
