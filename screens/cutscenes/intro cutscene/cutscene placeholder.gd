#POSSIBLE DIALOGUE FOR THE FOLLOWING CUTSCENES


#Katrin: Here is is, another piece. Thank you miss Uulga.
#Katrin: I guess we can go now, though it's a bit soon.
#Uulga: Turns out some Horg men and even Ghalbeens were here. Even knights from Tsuvookut. Poor Ivan, he must be devastated even his brothers were affected.
#Uulga: I must go back home. How about another trip on my ship before you all leave?
#Oscar: Yay, that'd be cool.
#On the ship
#Carrie: Miss Uulga... how did you lose your eye.
#Uulga: A few years back, I was fishing and then a sword-shark attacked me.
#Uulga: He stabbed my eye but then I ripped apart his blade and fought him back.
#Uulga: Made myself a nice meal out of what's left of him. But I still had to adapt to my eye loss.
#Pete: Cool, did you keep the blade?
#Uulga: I kept it in the ship's bedroom, above the bed.
#Ship returns to Herrko
#Melvin: Miss Uulga, thank you for helping us. Hope we get to see you again after we return home.
#Uulga: No problem, I gotta thank you all as well. I wouldn't have gone to that island if not for you.
#Angela: Really, but why?
#Uulga: They say that place has some dark secrets that could change everything about this world.
#Uulga: But you kids are outsiders who needed some help. Maybe focusing on that helped.
#Carrie: Well, most of us were scared when we got lost. But after everything we've been through, we realized we don't need fear to hold us back.
#Uulga: Exactly. I could tell there's something in you.
#Katrin: Maybe  we could go. Miss Uulga is there anything you'd like us to do before we leave?
#Uulga: Yes. Come here.
#Uulga hugs them
#Uulga: Go back home safely. I'm sure you kids can do it.
#The 6 leave
#Uulga: I know it won't be the last time I'll ever be in that island.
#Uulga: Still, I can't let fear conquer me.
#Uulga: Besides... I'd like to be a mother some day.
#Nort part 6
#The six could be arguing about their parents before meeting the alt versions
#Oscar: Carrie, is dad alright? Why would mom do something like that?
#Carrie: Oscar, like I said: Mom lost it. Even if she knows it, it's too late.
#Pete: Is that why dad doesn't want to talk with me? Is my entire life wrong?
#Katrin: Pete, don't say that. You have nothing to do with uncle. We stil love you and you love us back. You deserve to be happy and decide your fate.
#Angela: Why didn't you save dad? You could've done something.
#Melvin: Dad's the reason why you barely got to be with mom. He always wanted to go out anyway. Besides, uncle will take care of us.
#Carrie: Uh? What are you guys doing? 
#Alt Angela: This world is becoming less stable, though it was bound to happen.
#Alt Angela: We've been here for longer yet even we don't know what it is.
#Alt Angela: But someone told us that only some could ever return home. Because if 2 universes are too close to each other, one must go.
#Katrin: What are you guys talking about?
#Alt Oscar: It's either your group or ours. At least according to Knoe.
#Alt Oscar: I wish we all got along, we could've forgive you for what happened to Amalia.
#Alt Oscar: But now we got a chance to return home and we're getting desperate.
#Melvin: But we're the ones who have this box.
#Alt Angela: We've also had ours and it's more advanced. In truth, these objects do more than transdimensional travel.
#Alt Angela: They can affect reality too and yours, being an inferior object, might as well be causing issues around you.
#Alt Angela: It could erase you 6 without even knowing. But in our case, we can decide whether or not you get to return home.
#Carrie: You're insane! There's no way any of that is true. Can't you at least wait until my grandma saves my group?
#Alt Angela: The clock is ticking. You're all far behind, as you always were. Goodbye.
#Alt 6 vanish
#Oscar: I don't wanna die, sis! I don't wanna die.
#Katrin: We must figure something quick! Mel!
#Melvin: Hold on, the box is shaking, it seems to be moving towards somewhere.
#Melvin: Whatever it is, we should follow it.

#Katrin: Pete? What are you looking at?
#Pete: It's that thing... what is that?
#Melvin: Looks like a tree trunk... but is that a bone on the side?
#Carrie: Is that a lightning bolt? What's that behind?
#Pete: Looks like one of those transparent pool floaters.. but there's stuff inside.
#Katrin: Is it like those types of fish and sea life, that are transparents and weird looking?
#Angela: It has teeth too. Are those teeth?
#Oscar: He looks creepy... or is it a girl?
#HHGHH: HHHGHHH HHHGGGHHHGHGHG GGHHHH
#Melvin: What is that noise? Let's just get out of here!

#Melvin: Another piece. Let's see if it can help.
#Haunted house shows up
#Oscar: Carrie, I'm scared.
#Pete: This place looks scary. Did we die?
#??????: What difference does it make, when even the dead aren't free from this turmoil?
#Carrie: WHAT WAS THAT?
#??????: Teeheeheheheheheheheheheheee
#Katrin: Knock it off! We know someone's out there!
#??????: Poor souls....
#??????: Never did they know...
#??????: What hit them...
#??????: and it hit them so....
#Melvin: Who are you? I can tell by your voices you're just a bunch of kids.
#??????: Correct, we shall reveal ourselves.
#Kalub and Aliss show up
#Kalub: We are indeed kids.
#Aliss: As we've always been.
#Both: For centuries.
#Katrin: Why are you two blue? What happened?
#Kalub: We don't remember who we were before death...
#Aliss: Only that we might've been humans... like you...
#Angela: Whose house is this? Was it yours?
#Kalub: It's not just a house...
#Aliss: There's a lot more than that...

#Kalub and Aliss: Our group has been captured! Their souls are in danger.
#Melvin: What's going on?
#Kalub: It appears to be a strange ritual taking advantage of the undead.
#Aliss: And we can't interfere, for it is being manipulated by exorcists from the living world.
#Carrie: We're alive, you think you can save them?
#Kalub: We shall be grateful...
#Aliss: And we shall help back in return...

#Cornelius: We're free!
#Taaf: This putrid torture is over!
#Marcus: Hahahahaha! Not this time!
#Maikouto: Feels good to be back, doesn't?
#Beatrice: My children, where have you been?
#Kalub: These mortals were the ones that saved you.
#Aliss: We couldn't interfere, though it seems the ritual wasn't prevending outsiders that were alive.
#Kalub: Speaking of, how may we repay you?
#Katrin: No need to, honestly. We must leave and return home.
#Kalub: √çs it so?... *gets closer to Oscar* (could be a seperate panel on his own)
#Beatrice: Kalub! What did I say about taking blood from living children like him?
#Kalub: There's something about his blood... it has a familiar smell.
#Beatrice: How so?
#Beatrice: I see.. you two... share some blood with me?
#Carrie: How? Are we related?
#Beatrice: My name is Beatrice Margareen, which is one of the few things I remember from my past life.
#Beatrice: During that life, I might've had a family that went on by generations without me.
#Carrie: Margareen is my grandma's surname. But she never told that much about past family members.
#Beatrice: Did my family forget about me? And if so... was it unintentionally?
#Carrie: Maybe I could talk with my grandma about it. And that is if we return home.
#Melvin: We will, Carrie. That's why we must go. Whether we see anyone here again comes later.
#Carrie: Okay. Well, we must go. Good bye.
#Beatrice: Farewell, children. Live well, for as we undead had our living memories taken from us.
#Marcus: Who knows... maybe there's good reasons why we forgot everything except our names.
#Taaf: Some day... we shall all know our lost truths... it'll come at a price.
#Nort part 9
#Angela: What's going on? Are we coming back to those places?
#Carrie: What if they were right? Reality is falling apart.
#??????: But these effects are temporary. Normalcy can be achieved once again.
#Katrin: Who are you.
#AB-YZ: A simple enough name for me is AB-YZ. My real name can't be translated by your translation device of Hirdrih.
#AB-YZ: I've been watching you ever since you got lost. Oscar even saw me under the from of a red crystal.
#AB-YZ: The device you've used to come across worlds is indeed causing issues, as entities and elements from different worlds are being dragged here.
#AB-YZ: If you recall what Zarina Liefdei said, your device is part of a bigger object: One that can do more than just allow travelling through realities.
#AB-YZ: However, what the group of 6 from universe 5353 said about "close universes hurting each other" is false.
#AB-YZ: It is a fabrication of one named Knoe. Entities from similar universes can coexist.
#Carrie: So those others will get us killed based on a lie? And what do you mean by universe 53.. whatever that number is?
#AB-YZ: In my language, numbers are more complicated but I used familiar ones to simplify things. Your universe is 5356.
#AB-YZ: I category universes with specific numbers during my travels. But a majority of them are disappearing due to an unknown threat.
#AB-YZ: Meanwhile, the current effects we are witnessing can be stopped by your actions. You need to find one more piece to gain full control of that device.
#Carrie: I have another question. What exactly is this world that looks like Nortubel?
#AB-YZ: Unfortunately, many answers could be truth: It could be built from dreams of the people of Nortubel as it could be a copycat dimension, either build by some entity or out of nowhere, with no true creator or rules.
#AB-YZ: Some parts could be created, others could be directly borrowed from your world. This phenomenon applies to other worlds, even those you've visited.


#Pete: Who is that guy? He looks alien... is he from...
#Tfoorie: ???
#Pete: Uh... you're not gonna hurt us are you?
#Tfoorie: No. None of you are worthy. I seek true fighters.
#Lahiurn soldier: What's this weapon? Is it from the future? Perhaps we can study its technolo-
#Grek Multigun: WARNING. SECURITY SYTEM ACTIVE!
#Lahiurn soldier: AAAARRGH!
#Joolietta on the phone: Marlou? Are you there? I told you it'd happen...
#Joolietta on the phone: Uh? What do you mean the artifact isn't doing anything? Then how come?
#Matysha: Rico, you see this?
#Ricotto: Yes. You think the world is ending?
#Matysha: I always had moments I felt that. Whatever it is, we should still fight for our survival.
#Ivan and Lahrn surrounded by Scorbrions
#Ivan: There's more to come. How many did you got so far?
#Lahrn: We're almost on the same score. But I'm getting sick of these creatures. There has to be some other pest woth exterminating.
#Maikouto: You boys were obviously distracted. I got the highest score.
#Avietta: I think Leon and Otto might want to know what's goin on.
#Hangelica: Not yet... the end of times will not arrive soon...
#Leon: Um? Somethings going on with those 2. Seems their world has strange color related anomalies.
#Leon: Wait, that clown... 

#Carrie: So... you still believe that nonsense?
#Alt Angela: I don't want to... but if it means our lives are at risk, then we have no choice.
#AB-YZ: You must be from the other group. I must inform you tha-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-
#Katrin: ABYZ!!!!
#Knoe: Cease!
#Alt Oscar: Knoe warned us about these oddities. He says their mere existence causes holes in reality.
#Angela: Look... what is that?
#Melvin: It looks like a portal... but it's different from the others.
#Alt Pete: That's because it's coming from a more stable device. Unlike the broken one that you guys carry.
#Alt Katrin: And it's closing.
#Alt Angela: We better run... how about one last race, "brother"?
#Melvin: Everyone, stay close. We gotta make sure all of us get there!
#Mevlin: We've been through a lot and I promise this time.. we'll also go through this.
#Melvin: Maybe we can see our families again.
#Pete: But we're not sure what's in that portal... is it really home?
#Melvin: We don't know for sure... but we might as well try.

#Melvin: Come on, everyone, we're getting close.
#Melvin: Angela, grab my hand!
#Carrie: Oscar, grab mine.
#Katrin: Pete!
#Bonka: Everybody, grab these! (Bonka shows up with some rope ladders)
#Carrie: Bonka? HOLD ON!
#the portal closes, the characters fall to some place and seperate from the other 6
#Melvin: Unf, is everyone okay?
#Carrie: Yes, but... we failed!
#Melvin: THE BOX! IT'S BROKEN!
#Bonka: *start crying* NOOOO, THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!
#Bonka: I'm sorry! I wanted to help but... why didn't it work?
#Bonka: I finally did something good for once but in the end, it didn't work out.
#Katrin: Bonka...
#Bonka: I just wanted to make fun of people, you know... I never meant to hurt anybody... 
#Carrie: You know what? I actually believe you know. It wasn't you who tried getting us killed. According to a lady named Claudia, it could be someone named Bonkette.
#Bonka: Claudia? I think I heard of that name... 
#Carrie: But she might be from a different version of your world... like how those other kids are from a universe similar to ours...
#Bonka: And they will outlive you because of me... I'm sorry.
#Carrie: Bonka, it's alright... I forgive you... and I'm also sorry.
#Carrie: Guys? I love you all.
#Katrin: I love you too Carrie. And as much as I love Mel.
#Melvin: I love you both too... I really can't choose.
#Carrie: Oscar, you know you're the most precious thing in my life. Even if we never see our parents again, we have each other.
#Katrin: And Pete, you know I'd say the same about you. 
#Melvin: It's why we ran from home, Angela. We always had the feeling we'd be away from our parents sooner than expected. But we got each other.
#Pete: You know what? I may never know who my real dad is... but maybe I don't need to. I'm glad I live, so I could be with you all. Specially you Kat.
#Angela: I never got to see mom... but I at least have you, Mel.
#Oscar: Carrie, you're the best. Even if we also never see Grandma again... I hope I still have you.
#the group hugs
#something breaks, the group notices something... a silhouette of a familiar figure
#Yiegour: B-Man to Grek base... found the "Nortubese" kids... and the girl Leon talked about.
#Carrie: MISTER YIEGOUR! LEON?
#Leon: HELLO WORLD! Sadly, my brother isn't here with me but he's also helping with this situation.
#Katrin: How did you found us?
#Leon: It's that box of yours! Portals kept showing up and we got access to some places that you've visited.
#Leon: But believe it or not, Bonka once stepped into our world for a short period of time... and she didn't notice but I put in a translation device in her pocket, just in case she'd stumble to someone with different languages.
#Bonka: Is that why I got to understand what these guys were saying? 
#Melvin: How didn't you notice you had a strange object in your pocket?
#Bonka: I sometimes don't take off my clothes. *sniff* Now I smell worse than Bonky.
#Leon: Though another piece of information worth bringing up: I got in contact with Carrie and Oscar's Grandmother. This time, there's a chance for all of you to return.
#Yiegour: Not only that, this little guy says even other universes can be fixed and we've already helped some people.
#Yiegour: But in other cases, we also faced challenges... and you all might know how I fixed some.
#Leon: Though you still haven't killed or found that alien you kept talking about. In any case, we better get going.
#the 9 go to a journey and find a portal to Nortubel
#Carrie: This looks like home... you guys wanna come?
#Leon: I wouldn't mind... what about you 2?
#Bonka: Sure, maybe Nortubel can't be that bad of a place as I said it was.
#Yiegour: Maybe next time. I have work to do. Besides, I've met an amazing woman.
#Katrin: That's nice, mister Sarvotsky. What's her name?
#Yiegour: She's a tall, gorgeous powerfull warrior. Doesn't seem to be human but she's close enough.
#Katrin: ...is her name Uulga?
#Yiegour: She talked about you. Even hopes to see you again... and so do I.
#he lives.
#Oscar: Grandma!
#Pamela: Oscar! Carrie! (they hug)
#Stella: Kat! Pete!
#Bernard: Melvin! Angela! Welcome back!
#Shelly: It's so good to see you.
#Zarina: We're glad you're all safe.
#Shihiro: We never lost hope.
#Bao Bao: Arf Arf!
#Carrie: Oh and by the way. This is Bonka and Leon.
#Leon: Hello world! I'm from Hirdrih, a world of robots.
#Bonka: And I'm from Brinkaedea. I'm a clown... an actual clown...
#Stella: How about we introduce our place to you? There's a lot of nice stuff here.
#Leon: That'd be nice, because we hope to show you stuff from our worlds too.
#Pamela: Carrie, you know we're going to have to talk about your parents. Even your friends' parents.
#Carrie: I know, there's stuff to take care of, right?
#Pamela: But I know you kids went through a lot. So we could leave that for another occasion.
#Pamela: First, we should celebrate your return home.
#at a small party
#Bonka: Not bad, this Nortubel place. Though someone already got to that cake before I did.
#Leon: If you want, I could bring you to your world so you can bring some candy there and take it here. In fact, I could even invite more people.
#Bonka: Why didn't you say that before? 
#Leon: I was busy enjoying the party. It's not like it'll end soon.
#Bonka: Yeah, you're right.
#Pete: Oscar, feels good to be home, doesn't it.
#Oscar: Yes! Hey Angela, wanna play hide and seek?
#Angela: Sure, but can Pete be the one looking? He always picks the weirdest hiding places.
#Melvin: So, how you girls feel abo-
#the 2 both kill Mel's face
#Melvin: I... uh.. Thanks
#Carrie: Mel, like you said: Nobody wants to choose. Ain't that right Ka-
#Katrin kisses Carrie
#Carrie: Kat! Your mouth is full!
#Katrin: NOM oops, sorry... did some bits of food got into your mouth... I wanna see
#Carrie: Kat... come on...
#Melvin: After all of those places we've been, I wonder if we could see them again. Yiegour, Uulga, Booker, Kalub, Holmes... how are they doing?
#Melvin: In fact, what about those 6?
#Pamela: Mel? I just wanted to tell you that we've fixed the box. But we're keeping it in a safe place for now.
#Melvin: Alright. I get why. Now that I'm home again, I should take a break from going to all these places.... maybe next time.
#meanwhile in a strange place, the alt 6 are in a boat
#Alt Melvin with a telescope: Look there, I see something.
#Alt Angela: That's a ship, we need to get close.
#the ship opens up and with its advanced tech, picks up the group
#Alt Carrie: We're inside. Wow, it looks huge...
#Alt Oscar: Look at this stuff... is it from the future?
#Someone: Welcome aboard. 
#Said someone is using his hands on holographic screens
#Alt Pete: Thanks, sir but... why did you save us?
#Someone: Because we have important thigns to do... I know who you are...
#Alt Angela: Who are you, mister?
#Someone: You can call me Yiegour Sarvotsky.
#one of his holographic screens shows our main Yiegour listed as a potential target for this Yiegour
