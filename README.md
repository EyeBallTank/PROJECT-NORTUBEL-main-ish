# PROJECT-NORTUBEL-main

The game i want to make, under Godot 3.5 Win32; GLES3 sort of.

Code was taken from GDQuest's platformer tutorial series (In which i did finish from the 3 videos, so in a way i still wrote that code), Gonkee's "Jared AI" project and the Cubio demo. I plan to soon try and do my own code and improve on skills when using Godot's tools.

Both main actors share an "actor" script. Both have gravity but only one is playable by moving left/right and jumping, while the other can follow you around at a certain distance. The test level is very basic.

All art is placeholder and was made on MSPaint (As of writing this, i'm working on the main characters' sprites and may even show them on other sites that i use).

So far, i want to try and do things on my own, even if i take stuff from somewhere else. I may end up asking for help and assistance, even if that should be done later. Honestly, any help is appreciated and i'm trying to take this in a fun/hobby route as opposed to professionalism. I plan to make this game free.

# What exactly IS Project Nortubel?
A game where the player controls a character, who has to watch out for their younger sibling as they traverse through levels that should be fun and interesting. 

The actual story revolves around a group of 6 friends that get lost in some strange places and as they try to escape or even explore them, they encounter other people.

# A few current goals (Or rather wishes, to be honest; Will definitely need help) are:
* Make the Playable character have more health than the Companion character.
* Make the Companion character's moving speed a bit faster than the Playable character's moving speed.
* Add 2 basic commands ("Followme" and "Standstill") to allow the Playable character affect the Companion character's following activation (I'm considering trying a Finite State Machine).
* When the Companion character is not on camera, there should be some visual feedback indicating their place, like an arrow.
* Give the characters actual sprites (The game has 6 characters; 3 older siblings and 3 younger siblings; Each time a level presents 2 characters; Ideally, the player sprites change depending on the levels because each of the 3 sibling duos share the same gameplay mechanisms regardless of sprites).
* Add basic level design features like jump pads, keys and locked doors, switches, climbable ladders or pushable blocks.
* Add health pickups, score pickups, enemies, some sort of simple combat system and a bit of a stretch but something like a grappling hook-like feature.
* Add swimming (Which could also warrant an oxygen limit mechanic).
* Add NPC's and some sort of dialogue system (Even if i end up using the Dialogic addon by coppolaemilio).
* Work around menus and UI system, like a nice style that adds personality.
* With UI/HUD stuff in mind, some sort of ingame texts the player can read, whether they're helpful gameplay tips or lore/story stuff.
* A ingame gallery menu that the player can optionally visit, to see stuff like concept art and other types of illustrations.
* Some nice visuals, nothing too fancy or demanding (Specially depending on the art style).
* A third command based on special interacts should be done later.
* Maybe some unimportant interactions between siblings that aren't gameplay-relevant, like reading a book or playing a game.
* Sound design and music in general (Though this might as well be a last priority; At least i don't want voice acting at all).
* The option to change the game's language (While the default setting will be English, a second language in mind is Portuguese due its influences to the game's main setting)

I may end up changing this goal list as well.
# ALSO: Feel free to give me Github related tips in general.
I'm still a newcomer at this because of my complicated schedule, so i'm a bit behind.
